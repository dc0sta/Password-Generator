# Password-Generator :lock:
Password Generator my first project

This is the first project i made and uploaded on github, made in python, it is a password generator that when you put the size of the password it will give you the password with random letter digits and characters (some things are writen in portuguese as some kind of notes to teach myself and i am new so any help would be apreciated)

If i can i will update it in the future to make it better
